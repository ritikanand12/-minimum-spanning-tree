# Prim's Algorithm in C

This project implements Prim’s Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph using C programming language.

## 📌 Features
- Uses adjacency matrix representation
- Finds Minimum Spanning Tree
- Displays edges and weights
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

## 🛠 Algorithm Used
Prim’s Algorithm (Greedy Approach)

## 📊 Example Graph
The program uses a 4-vertex weighted graph.

## ▶ How to Run

1. Compile the program:
   gcc prims.c -o prims

2. Run the program:
   ./prims

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Graph Theory
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Greedy Algorithms
- C Programming
